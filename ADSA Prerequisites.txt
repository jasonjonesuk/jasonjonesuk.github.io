Prerequisites:  
•	PowerShell 5.0+ 
•	Active Directory Management Tools 
•	Group Policy Management Console 
 
The prerequisites are typically fulfilled by a Domain Controller, but could also be on an admin tools server. Customers can execute it from their workstation where admin tools are most likely installed, but it is not recommended. 
 

Running the scripts: 
•	Extract the scripts to C:\ADSA on a DC admin tools server or one of the DCs. The scripts should be in the root of this folder, not a sub-folder. 
 
Instructions to provide to the customer to run ADSA:
•	Launch PowerShell as an Administrator (make sure the user executing the scripts has Enterprise Admin rights. 
•	Get-ExecutionPolicy 
•	Take note on what the current executionpolicy is. It will most likely be RemoteSigned. Ask the customer to set it back after the scripts have executed. 
•	Set the executionpolicy temporarily to unrestricted: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
•	Run the PowerShell scripts: 
•	./Start-ADSADataCollection.ps1
•	Once these scripts have completed, request the customer zip the output files and provide them to you (recommended via Bitlocker/USB, but e-mail/password protected is acceptable).
